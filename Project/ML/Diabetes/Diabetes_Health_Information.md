### Diabetes Disease Columns:
- age in years
- BMI - Body Mass Index
- BloodPressure - the pressure of blood in a blood vessel in mmHg
- Glucose - amount of glucose in the blood in Mg/DL
- Insulin - anabolic hormone
- Pregnancies 
- SkinThickness

### Age
Age of the person in years.

##### Interpretation
- With increasing age, the chances of diabetes also increases

### BMI - Body Mass Index
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight.

##### Interpretation
- BMI below 18.5: Underweight
  - Underweight individuals may have a higher risk of nutritional deficiencies and other health issues.
- BMI between 18.5 and 24.9: Healthy Weight
- BMI between 25 and 29.9: Overweight
  - Overweight individuals have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
- BMI of 30 and above: Obesity
  - Obesity is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes.

##### How to Prevent
- Aim for a healthy weight by adopting a balanced diet and controlling portion sizes.
- Engage in regular physical activity to help manage weight and improve insulin sensitivity.
- Seek support from healthcare professionals or a registered dietitian to create a personalized weight management plan.

### BloodPressure
The pressure of blood in a blood vessel in mmHg.

##### Interpretation
- High blood pressure (Hypertension) - systolic pressure ≥ 130 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 80 mmHg:
  - Hypertension is a risk factor for diabetes-related complications, such as heart disease and kidney problems.
- Normal blood pressure - systolic pressure < 120 mmHg and diastolic pressure < 80 mmHg:
  - Maintaining normal blood pressure is essential for managing diabetes and reducing complications.

##### How to Prevent
- Follow a heart-healthy diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products.
- Limit sodium intake and avoid high-sodium processed foods to help control blood pressure.
- Engage in regular physical activity, which can help lower blood pressure and improve overall cardiovascular health.

### Glucose
The amount of glucose in the blood in mg/dL.

##### Interpretation
- Fasting glucose levels above 126 mg/dL: Diabetes
  - Elevated fasting glucose levels indicate diabetes, which requires careful management to prevent complications.
- Fasting glucose levels between 100 and 125 mg/dL: Prediabetes
  - Prediabetes is a warning sign, and lifestyle changes can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
- Fasting glucose levels below 100 mg/dL: Normal
- [source](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/getting-tested.html#:~:text=Fasting%20Blood%20Sugar%20Test,higher%20indicates%20you%20have%20diabetes.)

##### How to Prevent
- Adopt a balanced diet with a focus on whole foods, fiber-rich carbohydrates, and lean proteins.
- Engage in regular physical activity to improve insulin sensitivity and manage blood sugar levels.
- Monitor blood glucose levels regularly, and follow the guidance of healthcare professionals for diabetes management.

### Insulin
Insulin is an anabolic hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels.

##### Interpretation
- High insulin concentrations can cause hyperinsulinemia
- [source](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24178-hyperinsulinemia)

##### How to Prevent
- Diet, exercise and weight lose
- Regular blood sugar monitoring and working closely with healthcare professionals are vital for effective insulin management.

### Pregnancies
Number of times pregnant (applies to females only).

### SkinThickness
Thickness of the skinfold

##### Interpretation
- Skinfold thickness can be an indicator of body fat content.
- Higher skinfold measurements may be associated with increased diabetes risk in overweight or obese individuals.

##### How to Prevent
- Adopt a balanced diet and engage in regular physical activity to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.
- Seek support from healthcare professionals or registered dietitians to develop a personalized weight management plan.
- Regularly monitor body measurements, including skinfold thickness, to track changes in body fat levels.
