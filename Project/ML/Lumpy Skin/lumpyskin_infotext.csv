"x, y","Global Latitude and Longitude","Global Latitude and Longitude","The coordinates are a strong determinant of every other meteorological and geospatial parameter. This characteristic in itself, make x and y the best predictors for lumpy skin disease. LSD is endemic in Africa and the Middle East. Since 2015, several Southeastern European countries have been affected; the disease is spreading from the Balkans in a Northwestern direction. It is mainly transmitted by arthropods.","Consider relocating your cows."
"cld","Cloud Cover","Cloud cover refers to the fraction of the sky obscured by clouds on average when observed from a particular location.","Cloud cover has a correlation with rainfall, which affects vectors (moskitoes etc) and has a positive correlation with the spread of lumpy skin disease.","Consider relocating to a place with less rainfall."
"frs","Frost","Average number of days per month with presence of frost.","Blood-feeding insects such as mosquitos and flies act as mechanical vectors to spread the disease. The virus has been isolated from Stomoxys, Biomyia fasciata, Tabanidae, Glossina, and Culicoides species, all of which can not survive an extended time under freezing temperatures. The higher the number frost days, the lower the transmission of the lumpy skin virus.","Relocate to colder regions or install insect-protection."
"pre","Precipitation","Average quantity of precipitation in mm per month.","Outbreaks of lumpy skin disease are associated with high humidity and are more prevalent near bodies of water. Tropical regions have thus a higher presence of lumpy skin disease with around 150-200 mm per month.","Reduce amount of bodies of water near your pasture."
"tmn, tmp, tmx","Temperature","Average daily minimun, mean and maximun temperature in Celsius.","The prevalence of lumpy skin disease is higly associated with the temperature. Outrbreaks are associated with high temperatures, while colder temperatures hinder its transmission. Given this, the higher this three coefficients are, the higher the possibility of lumpy skin disease infection.","Consider relocating to colder climates."
"vap","Vapour Pressure","Mean vapour pressure in millibars.","Vapour pressure is and indicator of air saturation (quantity of water air holds). Vapour pressure around 20 or higher is considered high humidity is a predictor of lumpy skin disease.","Consider relocating to more arid climates."
"wet","Wetness","Average number of days per month with presence of rain.","Outbreaks of lumpy skin disease are dependent upon animal, wind, and rainfall patterns, which affect the vector (moskitoes etc) populations. The increase in number of rainy days per month is positively correlated with the spread of lumpy skin disease.","Keep tabs on vector populations and take steps to reduce or protect from them in rainy seasons."
"dominant_land_cover","Most Dominant Land Cover","Category of most dominant land cover around the given case. Forest, Agriculture, Desert, Shrubs, Grassland, Built-up area, Wetlands, Rainforest, Barren land, Ice/Snow, and Inland water.","Lumpy skin disease infections occur within specific geographic distributions. It is most prominent in tropical, low-lying areas or near bodies of water.","Relocate to a non-tropical region away from bodies of water."
