### Age
Age of the person in years.

##### Interpretation
- the older, the higher the risk for heart disease
- interpret our own data for statistical info on age
- if youre healthier, you lower the risk of heart disease at a higher age
- [[https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)]] 

### Sex
Sex of the person, male/female

##### Intepretation
- men = greater risk of a heart attack, & at younger age than women
- women = greater rate at later age

##### How to prevent
- become trans

### cp - Chest Pain Type
**Angina** = pain that comes from reduced blood flow to the heart, can be a sign of heart disease. Can be in different places, not only in chest. Can present in lead-up to heart attack.

##### Interpretation
0. asymptomatic = no angina
1. atypical angina = chest discomfort, more like an indigestion feeling **(women have this)**
2. non-anginal
3. typical angina = reduced blood flow to the heart, tightness/heaviness in chest **(the type of chest pain men have)**

In the lead-up to a heart attack, men usually have typical angina (chest pain) - women have atypical angina where there is no strong chest pain per se but discomfort, fatigue, shortness of breath.

Anigna most common > 60 yr olds

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373

##### How to prevent
- less tobacco/alcohol
- lower blood pressure
- lower cholesterol
- more exercise
- less stress
- warmer temps


### Trestbps - Resting Blood Pressure
trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to hospital)
Pressure of the blood pumping in your veins. 
- Top Number: Systolic pressure = pressure in arteries while in a Systole phase (heart beat)
- Bottom Number: Diastolic pressure = pressure in arteries in a Diastole phase (between heart beats)

##### Interpretation
- high blood pressure: (Hypertension)
	- higher than 120/80
	- can lead to heart disease / damage to the heart / angina
- low blood pressure = good
	- lower than 120/80

##### How to change


### Chol - Serum Cholesterol
chol - serum cholesterol in mg/dl

Cholesterol = sterol
- component of cell membranes (30% of all membranes = cholesterol)
- and many other things
- synthetised by body & taken in by food

The level of cholesterol in the blood serum (the part of blood without the blood cells in it).
There are dfferent types of Cholesterol:
- HDL (high-density Lipoprotein) - **good**
	- absorbs cholesterol in blood, this is then carried to liver, where it ends up getting flushed from body 
	- can lower risk for heart disease
- LDL (low-density Lipoprotein) - **bad**
	- not transported away
	- builds up plaque on walls of blood vessels, making them narrower -> bad

##### Interpretation
- high serum cholesterol = associated with heart disease mortality
- healthy levels:
	- total cholesterol: $\leq$ 5 mmol/L 
	- total to HDL ratio: $<$ 6
	- HDL: $\geq$ 1 mmol/L (men); $\geq$ 1.2 mmol/L (women)
	- LDL: $\leq$ 4 mmol/L

##### How to change
- if caused by lifestyle: caused by eating fatty foods, not enough exercise, smoking, alcohol
	- more exercise
	- eat more healthy
	- drink less & smoke less
	- lose weight
- if caused by inherited condition
	- medicine

### FBS - Fasting Blood Sugar
fbs - fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

Glucose in the blood when fasting. 
Diabetes is also associated with heart disease & increases risk for heart disease; diabetes leads to more glucose in blood.

##### Interpretation
- fasting glucose levels above 120 mg/dl increases risk for heart disease
- lower fasting glucose levels do not increase risk, however
	- too low levels (< 70 mg/dl) can increase risk for stroke
- Why:
	- abnormal glucose metabolism can lead to plaques
	- can also lead to impaired endothelial function (the membrane that lines heart & blood vessels, the cells are responsibl for controlling vascular relaxation & contraction, blood clotting etc)
	- also thrombosis

##### How to change
- not have diabetes?


### Restecg - Resting Electrocardiographic Results
restecg - resting electrocardiographic results 

##### Interpretation
0. lv hypertrophy (showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria)
	- thickening of walls of lower left heart chamber (left ventricle - the main chamber that pumps blood into aorta) -> blood pressure increases -> harder to pump blood for heart
	- causes: high blood pressure, intense physical activity
	- consequences: heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmia
1. normal
2. stt abnormality (having ST-T wave abnormality = T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
	- a little bit more frequent in women than in men (8% vs 6%)
	- there may be a risk for heart disease if you have stt abnormalities with no apparent heart disease, could be used as an early marker. If you have this and do not have heart disease, maybe get it checked out.

##### How to change
- lv hypertophy
	- medication (if because of blood pressure), surgery, depending on the cause
	- prevent by eating healthy, exercising, no stress, no smoking

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1880427611800451

### Thalach - Max Heart Rate
thalach - max heart rate achieved

##### Interpretation
typical Max Heart Rate depends on age: 
- subtract your age from 220 
- for moderate-insentity physical activity: healthy heart rate should be between 64% and 76% of your max heart rate

- high max heart rate -> high risk for heart disease & cardiovascular mortality
- also low max heart rate bad?

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8574463/

##### How to change
- excercise?


### Exang - Exercise induced Angina
exang - exercise induced angina
	0. false
	1. true

Angina (see above) usually induced by exercise/exertion because then the heart needs to pump more blood / body needs more oxygen.

##### Interpretation
- see above

##### How to change
- see above

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373


### Oldpeak - ST Depression (ECG)
oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (ST refers to ECG plot)

When exercising, the ST segment of a ECG can change relative to the ST segment during rest, which can be an indicator for heart disease.
The stress test is usually done on a treadmill until the heart rate is 85% of the max heart rate, while ECG results are recorded.

##### Intepretation
abnormal when:
	- upsloping depression
	- horizontal or downsloping depression
- duration also important

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4958709/

##### How to change
- more exercise? less heart disease


### Slope - slope of the ST segment (ECG)
slope of peak exercise ST segment (see above)

##### Interpretation
0. downsloping
	- if this happens at a lower heart rate -> indicates worse prognosis, higher likelihood of heart disease
1. flat
2. upsloping
	- usually seen as equivocal result to downsloping

##### How to change
- see above

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4958709/


### Ca - number of major vessels coloured by fluoroscopy
ca -  number of major vessels coloured by fluoroscopy (0-3)

A catheter is inserted into an artery of the heart, then a fluorescent dye used to colour major vessels, which then can be seen with an X-Ray. You can then see quality of blood flow by seeing how many vessels are coloured by fluoroscopy.

##### Interpretation
- the more major blood vessels coloured by fluoroscopy, the better the blood flow
-> the lower the risk for Heart Disease

https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fluoroscopy.html


### Thal - Thalassemia
thal - thalassemia (blood flow in the heart)

Inherited disease that makes body not produce enough hemoglobin -> less oxygen in red blood cells.

##### Interpretation
1. fixed defect (ischemia) (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
2. normal blood flow
3. reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassemia


### Target - Heart Disease and Stages
target - heart disease and stages

##### Interpretation
0. no heart disease
1. stage
2. stage
3. stage
4. stage
