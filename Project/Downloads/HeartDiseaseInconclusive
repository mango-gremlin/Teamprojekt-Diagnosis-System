ADDITIONAL INFORMATION/PRECAUTIONS

=======SMOKED AT LEAST 100 CIGARETTES=======


---MEANING
Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life? (Note: 5 packs = 100 cigarettes)

---INTERPRETATION
Smokers are more likely than non-smokers to develop heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. Smokers are at greater risk for diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease).

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Reduce or quit smoking: Quitting smoking is one of the most important actions people can take to improve their health. This is true regardless of their age or how long they have been smoking.

=======EVER HAD A STROKE=======


---MEANING
A stroke is a serious life-threatening medical condition that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off.

---INTERPRETATION
If the supply of blood to the brain is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death. People who survive a stroke are often left with long-term problems caused by injury to their brain.
Women and men have a much higher risk of dangerous heart problems soon after their first stroke compared to people without stroke, even if they don't have obvious underlying heart disease, a study has found.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
You can significantly reduce your risk of having a stroke if you: eat well, take regular exercise, don't drink alcohol, don't smoke.
If you've had a stroke in the past, these measures are particularly important because your risk of having another stroke is greatly increased.

=======HEAVY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION=======


---MEANING
Alcohol is poisonous to the body and needs to be metabolised by the liver. Heavy alcohol consumption, as with any heavy substance abuse, can have adverse health effects.

---INTERPRETATION
Heavy drinking, on the other hand, is linked to a number of poor health outcomes, including heart conditions. Excessive alcohol intake can lead to high blood pressure, heart failure or stroke. Excessive drinking can also contribute to cardiomyopathy, a disorder that affects the heart muscle.
Light-to-moderate drinking (1 to 14 drinks/week) is associated with a significant reduction in progressive heart failure and hospitalization. However, there were no positive effects in subjects with mechanical or electrical dysfunction of heart muscle, or nonischemic heart disease, and although not significant, there was a slight risk for hospitalization for heart failure.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Reduce the amount of drinks you have in a week to less than 14 for men, 7 for women. (1 drink= 355 ml beer / 118 ml wine / 44 ml spirits)
If you have certain heart rhythm abnormalities or heart failure, you should avoid even that much or not drink at all.

=======DIFFICULTY WALKING OR CLIMBING STAIRS=======


---MEANING
Difficulty walking or climbing stairs.

---INTERPRETATION
The more risk factors people have for heart disease, the faster their decline in walking speed.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
As difficulty walking is connected to risk factors for heart disease, treating the underlying causes can improve difficulty walking.

=======SEX OF PERSON (MALE/FEMALE)=======


---MEANING
sex of person (male/female)

---INTERPRETATION
Men have a greater risk to suffer from heart attacks than women, and a greater risk of having a heart attack at a younger age than women do. Women have a higher risk for heart attack at a later age than men.
