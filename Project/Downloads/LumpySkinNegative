ADDITIONAL INFORMATION/PRECAUTIONS

=======GLOBAL LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE=======


---MEANING
Global Latitude and Longitude

---INTERPRETATION
The coordinates are a strong determinant of every other meteorological and geospatial parameter. This characteristic in itself, make x and y the best predictors for lumpy skin disease. LSD is endemic in Africa and the Middle East. Since 2015, several Southeastern European countries have been affected; the disease is spreading from the Balkans in a Northwestern direction. It is mainly transmitted by arthropods.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Consider relocating your cows.

=======FROST=======


---MEANING
Average number of days per month with presence of frost.

---INTERPRETATION
Blood-feeding insects such as mosquitos and flies act as mechanical vectors to spread the disease. The virus has been isolated from Stomoxys, Biomyia fasciata, Tabanidae, Glossina, and Culicoides species, all of which can not survive an extended time under freezing temperatures. The higher the number frost days, the lower the transmission of the lumpy skin virus.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Relocate to colder regions or install insect-protection.

=======TEMPERATURE=======


---MEANING
Average daily minimun, mean and maximun temperature in Celsius.

---INTERPRETATION
The prevalence of lumpy skin disease is higly associated with the temperature. Outrbreaks are associated with high temperatures, while colder temperatures hinder its transmission. Given this, the higher this three coefficients are, the higher the possibility of lumpy skin disease infection.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Consider relocating to colder climates.

=======VAPOUR PRESSURE=======


---MEANING
Mean vapour pressure in millibars.

---INTERPRETATION
Vapour pressure is and indicator of air saturation (quantity of water air holds). Vapour pressure around 20 or higher is considered high humidity is a predictor of lumpy skin disease.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Consider relocating to more arid climates.

=======WETNESS=======


---MEANING
Average number of days per month with presence of rain.

---INTERPRETATION
Outbreaks of lumpy skin disease are dependent upon animal, wind, and rainfall patterns, which affect the vector (moskitoes etc) populations. The increase in number of rainy days per month is positively correlated with the spread of lumpy skin disease.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Keep tabs on vector populations and take steps to reduce or protect from them in rainy seasons.

=======MOST DOMINANT LAND COVER=======


---MEANING
Category of most dominant land cover around the given case. Forest, Agriculture, Desert, Shrubs, Grassland, Built-up area, Wetlands, Rainforest, Barren land, Ice/Snow, and Inland water.

---INTERPRETATION
Lumpy skin disease infections occur within specific geographic distributions. It is most prominent in tropical, low-lying areas or near bodies of water.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Relocate to a non-tropical region away from bodies of water.
