ADDITIONAL INFORMATION/PRECAUTIONS

=======PREGNANCIES=======


---MEANING
Number of times pregnant (applies to females only).

---INTERPRETATION
During pregnancy there is a 2-10% chance for a woman to develop gestational diabetes. It is caused by the body not being able to produce enough insulin during pregnancy, since body changes during pregnancy can lead to insulin resistance (which leads to higher insulin demand). Women are even more likely to get gestational diabetes if they already had an insulin resistance before the pregnancy.

---HOW TO IMPROVE
Before getting pregnant, one way to prevent gestational diabetes is losing weight if one is overweight, and regular physical activity. (do not try to lose weight while pregnant)
To help prevent during pregnancy: Checking blood sugar levels regularly, eating healthy foods (not too much, not too little), regular physical activity, and going to the doctor often to monitor the baby.
